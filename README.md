# WebPuzac
A tool for webcrawling

*Current code info:*

The program is capable of looking at any url you give it and scraping all the links on that page. For now that all it is capable of.


*Next update:*

Adding a user interaction so that you can input the url into the program and start scraping from a given url instead of having to change the starting url in the code. 
When a crawler ends its link search you will be able to tell it which of given links it will jump to next


*Very important stuff:*

This program is open source so you can use it as a platform for further modofication
Be careful with webcrawling on social networks because if you do that, you are putting yourself in a position where you can be sued by owners of the social networks for scraping their data.
More on that here: https://benbernardblog.com/web-scraping-and-crawling-are-perfectly-legal-right/


*How to run it?*

The program requies a pip install, to do that open command prompt and type: pip install bs4

BeautifulSoup (bs4) is a HTML parser used to convert website info to HTML
After you have installed what you need, you should go to the source code and change the value of the my_url variable to the url you want to scrape.
When you write the url you must write it whole (so you should write https://www.google.com instead of just www.google.com)


Thats all for now folks, enjoy
