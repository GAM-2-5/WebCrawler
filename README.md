# WebPuzac
A tool for webcrawling

This program is capable of searching specified information from a website or mapping website links
With certain modification it can also be capable of gathering links for a web browser or search the net itself for a specified phrase, code or something else

Along with that this program is (will be) open source so you can use it as a platform for further modofication
Be careful with webcrawling on social networks because if you do that, you are putting yourself in a position where you can be sued by owners of the social networks for scraping their data (more info on that when i release).

Aside from that have fun with it (when i release it ofc)
