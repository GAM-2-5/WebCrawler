# WebCrawler
A webcrawling tool

 The program is capable of looking at any url you give it and scraping all the links on that page and keeps scraping links on other pages it found.


*Very important stuff:*
 This program is open source so you can use it as a platform for further modification
Be careful with webcrawling on social networks because if you do that, you are putting yourself in a position where you can be sued by owners of the social networks for scraping their data.

*Before running a program:*
 The program requies a few packages, to install them, open command prompt and type: 

pip install bs4

pip install colorama

pip install urllib3

pip install requests


*How to run a program?*
 The program is made to guide you trough using it, if something is not clear about what you have to do or how it works, type help anywhere and it will tell you what you want to know

*Switching between modes:*
 You can switch between auto and manual mode. 
When a program asks you if you want to proceed you have to tell it 'no' and it will ask if you want to switch to the other mode, if you say yes it will show you the same list again and ask you to proceed, and if you say no it will end the program.

Thats all for now folks, enjoy
